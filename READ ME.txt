Verified Raspberry Pi environment, OS, Python version, and libcamera installation.

Confirmed SSH access to the Pi over a hotspot and remote control.

Verified that two cameras were attached via libcamera logs.

ran minimal test scripts to capture images from camera 0; photosare blurry.

Attempted single-frame capture with Picamera2; output bad - blurry

Increased capture delay to 2–5 seconds to allow exposure to stabilize; slight improvement in clarity.

Saved images using unique timestamped filenames to avoid overwriting.

Attempted OCR using pytesseract on initial captures; output was empty.

Adjusted camera distance and angle to the card; negligible improvement.

Tweaked lighting direction and intensity to reduce glare; OCR still failed.

Experimented with manually adjusting camera focus through Picamera2 (if supported); minimal effect.

Attempted capture from front and back cameras - stil blurry

Captured multiple frames per camera and calculated sharpness via Laplacian variance (sharpness measure); successfully isolated the sharpest frame.

Attempted cropping around the center of the image to focus on the card; minor improvement for preprocessing.

Applied grayscale conversion using OpenCV to prepare for thresholding.

Applied contrast enhancement (CLAHE) to improve visibility of text edges.

Applied adaptive thresholding to further isolate text regions.

Applied simple morphological operations (dilate) to thicken text lines; small improvement in clarity.

Attempted pytesseract OCR on processed images; still failed to parse stylized Pokémon card text reliably. #this one is terrible

Researched modern computer vision workflows; discovered classical OCR - will attempt

should i use AI-assisted and LLM-based OCR ? - need to find a solution that DOESNT require internet though

made sure Everyuthing was good on venv

Captured 5 frames per camera per run; automatically selected the sharpest frame for processing.

End-to-end script captures, processes, and outputs JSON metadata for both cameras successfully.
